				"text": "First, we have to agree on some notation. A Sudoku puzzle is a grid of 81 squares; the majority of enthusiasts label the columns 1-9, the rows A-I, and call a collection of nine squares (column, row, or box) a unit and the squares that share a unit the peers. A puzzle leaves some squares blank and fills others with digits, and the whole idea is:<br><br>A puzzle is solved if the squares in each unit are filled with a permutation of the digits 1 to 9.<br><br>That is, no digit can appear twice in a unit, and every digit must appear once. This implies that each square must have a different value from any of its peers. Here are the names of the squares, a typical puzzle, and the solution to the puzzle:"

				"text": "If you are not familiar with some of the features of Python, note that a dict or dictionary is Python's name for a hash table that maps each key to a value; that these are specified as a sequence of (key, value) tuples; that dict((s, [...]) for s in squares) creates a dictionary which maps each square s to a value that is the list [...]; and that the expression [u for u in unit list if s in u] means that this value is the list of units u such that the square s is a member of u. So read this assignment statement as \"units is a dictionary where each square maps to the list of units that contain the square \". Similarly, read the next assignment statement as \"peers is a dictionary where each square s maps to the set of squares formed by the union of the squares in the units of s, but not s itself\".<br><br>It can't hurt to throw in some tests (they all pass):"
